# Getting and Cleaning Data
This repository is for submission of project, coursera course. 
Part of the Data Science Specialization Â»
"Getting and Cleaning Data" coursera ->  https://class.coursera.org/getdata-030/

Learn how to gather, clean, and manage data from a variety of sources. This is the third course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
This submittion is inclused the following file:
- Readme file (README.md: This file)
- Code book (CodeBook.md) - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
- Source file (run_analysis.R) 
- output file (as STEP5)
 code book that  called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

# Project Summary
I created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
